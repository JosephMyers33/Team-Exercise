One day a hund named Schatze decided to stage the ultimate heist, stealing a Bratworst from the Schloss Eltz.
In order to do so, he first needs to get past a Wache named Hans who carries a big Schwert.
What Schatze didn't realize is, Hans was mesmerized by the Klimaanlage malfunctioning and blasting cold air like it was a Flughafen during wintertime.
