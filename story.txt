One day a hund named Schatze decided to stage the ultimate heist, stealing a Bratworst from the Schloss Eltz.
Schatze's daring escape led him down the Hauptstrasse, where he cleverly dodged passersby and disappeared into the bustling crowd.
What Schatze didn't realize is, Hans was mesmerized by the Klimaanlage malfunctioning and blasting cold air like it was a Flughafen during wintertime.
