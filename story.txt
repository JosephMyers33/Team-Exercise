One day a hund named Schatze decided to stage the ultimate heist, stealing a Bratworst from the Schloss Eltz.
Schatze's daring escape led him down the Hauptstrasse, where he cleverly dodged passersby and disappeared into the bustling crowd.
Amidst the crowd, Schatze suddenly became hungry despite the Bratworst from before, so he ran into a Ratskeller and ordered a Doener kebab.
