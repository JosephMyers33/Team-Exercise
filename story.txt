One day a hund named Schatze decided to stage the ultimate heist, stealing a Bratworst from the Schloss Eltz.
Schatze's daring escape led him down the Hauptstrasse, where he cleverly dodged passersby and disappeared into the bustling crowd.
Amidst the crowd, Schatze suddenly became hungry despite the Bratworst from before, so he ran into a Ratskeller and ordered a Doener kebab.
After visiting Schloss Eltz and admiring its grandeur, we sat in a Biergarten enjoying Bratwurst and Apfelkuchen.
Now Schatze realized he is running late, so he left the biergarten and stole a BMW X5 just idled in the parking lot.
His next destination was the Flughafen, where he hoped to catch a quick flight out of town.
In Berlin, we walked down Hauptstrasse to a Baeckerei where we bought fresh Brot and delicious Gebaeck.
